                        <br>STUDY LOCATION(S): Online participation<br>

                    <br>SUMMARY OF KEY INFORMATION:
                    The information provided below includes a brief yet complete summary of key information about the research, presented first as required by the federal regulations. Some sections that require additional information may be repeated later in this document.
                    <p>
                        <i>Participation is Voluntary</i>
                    <br>You are being asked to participate in a research study.  Participation is completely voluntary.  Please read the information below carefully.
                    <p>
                    <i>Study Purpose</i>
                    <br>The purpose of this research study is to assess the computational and neural processes underlying discovery, generalization and application of predictive information.
                    <p>
                    <i>Study Procedures</i>
                    <br>You will be asked to engage in a computer-based task in which you will make decisions, solve problems, and/or indicate preferences.
                    <p>
                    <i>Expected Duration</i>
                    <br>Participation in the study will include a single session and take a total of 30 to 90 minutes, depending on the specific task.  The exact timing will be as specified in the SONA or HIT listing
                    <p>
                    <i>Risks of Participation</i>
                    <br>The more notable risks of participation include eye-strain from looking at a computer screen for several minutes at a time, and/or fatigue from concentrating on the stimuli and tasks.
                    <p>
                    <i> Benefits to Participants</i>
                    <br>You will not directly benefit from participation in this study.
                    <p>
                    <i>Benefits to Others or Society</i>
                    <br>Impairments in predictive learning have been associated with a wide range of behavioral, psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including drug addiction, schizophrenia, depression and dementia.  Using healthy, normal, individuals to further an understanding of the processes underlying predictive learning will yield insights into dysfunctions manifested in these clinical populations.
                    <p>
                    <i>Alternative Procedures or Treatments</i>
                    <br>If you are being compensated for your participation with course credit, the course instructor offering extra course credit for participation in research must provide alternatives to earn extra course credit. The alternative assignment must require equal or less time and effort for the same amount of earned extra credit that you can earn through participation in research.

                    <p>
                    <br>HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?
                    <br>This study will include approximately 1000 participants.  All study procedures will be done online.

                    <p>
                    <br>AM I ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS STUDY?
                    <br>You must meet the following requirements to be in the study: You are between 18 and 75 years old, able to read and speak English, have normal vision (can be corrected to normal through the use of glasses or contact lenses), are of good health and free of neurological disease and do not have a recent history of illicit drug use.

                    <p>
                    <br>WHAT PROCEDURES ARE INVOLVED WITH THIS STUDY AND HOW LONG WILL THEY TAKE?
                    <br>1.	You will be asked to complete a questionnaire that requests information about your gender, ethnicity and race. You may also be asked to complete a brief survey assessing your personality traits and/or life experiences.  Then, you will be asked to engage in a task in which various images are presented on the screen. These images may represent hypothetical “real world” events, or may simply be abstract colors and shapes that are displayed with some spatial or temporal proximity.  You may be asked to rate the pleasantness of these events, or to provide estimates of their predictive or causal relationships, and to indicate your confidence in such estimates.  In some tasks, you may be required to choose between alternative actions, such as pressing a button or moving the mouse, in order to transition through a visually depicted environment, to reach a desired goal state, or to indicate your preference for one event over another.  Other times, you may be asked to watch as some other individual(s), or the computer, selects among options. All responses will be recorded by the computer. The total time to complete the task ranges from 30 to 90 minutes, depending on the specific task, and is as specified in the SONA or HIT study information.
                    <br>
                    <br>2.	Participation in the study will include a single session and take a total of about 30-90 minutes depending on the task.

                    <p>
                    <br>WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE DISCOMFORTS OR RISKS RELATED TO THE STUDY?
                    <br>There are no known harms or discomforts associated with this study beyond those encountered in normal daily life.  The possible risks and/or discomforts associated with the procedures described in this study include: Eye strain from looking at a computer screen for several minutes at a time, and/or fatigue from concentrating on the stimuli and tasks.  If you experience any of these known symptoms, the study will be halted immediately. To reduce any discomfort, you will pace yourself through the trials and will be encouraged to take short breaks throughout the duration of the experiment (approximately every 30 minutes). Some participants may also experience discomfort associated with reflecting on particular emotions or life experiences while completing questionnaires.

                    <p>
                    <br>WILL I BE PAID FOR TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?
                    <br><i>Compensation</i>
                    <br>You may be participating in this study for financial compensation or for UCI course credit. If you are participating for financial compensation, you will be paid $10 per hour of participation. In addition to this baseline compensation for participation, in some experiments, monetary reward contingencies are employed such that you may earn up to $15 based on the actions you perform and/or the stimuli with which you are presented.  Thus, if you participate in a 1 hour session in which monetary reward contingencies are employed, you will be compensated a minimum of $10 and may be compensated up to $25.  All monetary compensation will be provided electronically at the end of the session.
                    <br>
                    <br>If you are participating for course credit, you will receive 1 unit of eligible course credit for every 1 hour of participation. You will be responsible for distributing those credits to your eligible course through the UCI Social Sciences human subjects website (SONA).
                    <br>
                    <br><i>    Costs </i>
                    <br> There is no cost to you for participation in this study.

                    <p>
                    <br>WHAT HAPPENS IF I WANT TO STOP TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?
                    <br>You are free to withdraw from this study at any time. If you elect to withdraw or are withdrawn from this research study, your data will be excluded from the analysis of study data and deleted.
